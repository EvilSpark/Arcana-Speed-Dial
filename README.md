# Simple Speed Dial

A clean and modern speed dial for Firefox and Chrome, inspired by Opera

-   Respects your privacy. Unlike other speed dial addons, there is no tracking
-   Automatically generates thumbnails and screenshots, or select your own
-   Uses the browser's native bookmarks library so speed dials can be synced
-   Sortable with drag and drop
-   Fast and stable
